## Abstract

Recent DESI DR2 results (2025) provide growing hints (~2.8–4.2σ in combined probes, depending on supernova compilation) that dark energy evolves over cosmic time, with w(z) deviating from the constant −1 of ΛCDM and contributing to the Hubble tension (local H₀ ≈ 73 km/s/Mpc vs. CMB ≈ 67 km/s/Mpc).

Motivated by Niels Bohr’s complementarity principle—where quantum entities cannot simultaneously exhibit full wave and particle character—we propose that vacuum fluctuations in a scalar field ϕ undergo staggered, probabilistic collapses. This damps catastrophic energy spikes from the naive quantum vacuum (~10¹²⁰ mismatch with observed dark energy) naturally via hyperdiffusion and effective nonlinear advection from turbulent mode cascades.

The toy model Lagrangian is:

L = ½ (∂ϕ/∂t)² − ½ (∂ϕ/∂x)² − ½ m² ϕ² + (κ/2) (∂²ϕ/∂x²)²

yielding the damped Klein-Gordon equation of motion:

∂²ϕ/∂t² − ∂²ϕ/∂x² + m² ϕ + κ ∂⁴ϕ/∂x⁴ = 0

To capture turbulence-like nonlinear advection from complementarity-induced staggered collapses, we include a phenomenological term β ϕ ∂ϕ/∂x in the effective equation of motion:

∂²ϕ/∂t² − ∂²ϕ/∂x² + β ϕ ∂ϕ/∂x + κ ∂⁴ϕ/∂x⁴ = 0

Casimir suppression enters through curvature boundaries, bridging quantum scales fractally to cosmology. In the mean-field limit, this yields an effective w evolving from near −1 (wave-dominant, high repulsion) at high z to milder values locally (more particle collapses in structures). Voids remain calmer (reduced push, w less negative), while filaments surge—predicting directional asymmetries (∆z/z ∼0.05–0.10), filament-vs-void supernova brightening differences, drifting CMB cold spots (~1°/Gyr), and a smooth Hubble gradient without new physics beyond quantum principles.

The model is falsifiable with upcoming surveys including Euclid weak lensing/supernova anisotropies (cosmology release ~October 2026), DESI BAO environmental probes, Roman Space Telescope, and CMB-S4.

## Key Visualizations


## Model Highlights

- Resolves the ~10¹²⁰ cosmological constant problem through probabilistic collapses and fractal turbulence self-similarity
- Predicts redshift evolution of the equation of state w(z): ≈ −1 at high redshift → less negative in local voids
- Incorporates nonlinear Burgers-like advection leading to robust filament formation and environmental variations
- Requires no new particles or extreme fine-tuning

## Observational Predictions

- Redshift-dependent directional asymmetry (∆z/z ≈ 0.05–0.10)
- Brighter supernovae in filaments compared to voids
- CMB cold spot drift (~1° per Gyr)
- Smooth late-time Hubble gradient reconciling local (~73 km/s/Mpc) and CMB (~67 km/s/Mpc) measurements

These predictions are testable with upcoming data releases from Euclid (~Oct 2026), DESI BAO environmental splits, Roman Space Telescope, and CMB-S4. Detection of >3σ anisotropies or gradients would strongly favor this quantum-turbulent origin for evolving dark energy over constant Λ.
