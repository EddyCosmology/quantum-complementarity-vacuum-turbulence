*The cosmic web: galaxy filaments and vast voids — where this model predicts varying dark energy push (stronger in structures, calmer in voids).*

### Quick Summary
This toy model proposes that **quantum complementarity** (Bohr's principle: no simultaneous full wave + particle behavior) causes staggered probabilistic collapses in vacuum fluctuations of a scalar field ϕ. This naturally damps the infamous ~10¹²⁰ vacuum energy catastrophe without fine-tuning, while nonlinear advection and hyperdiffusion introduce turbulence-like inhomogeneities.

Result: Dark energy evolves over time (w(z) from ~−1 at high z to less negative locally) and varies spatially (filaments surge, voids calm) — potentially resolving DESI 2025 hints of dynamical dark energy **and** the Hubble tension, all from established quantum principles + Casimir suppression.

### Key Features & Predictions
- Effective equation of state w evolves with redshift and environment.
- Directional redshift asymmetries (Δz/z ~0.05–0.10).
- Brighter supernovae in filaments vs. voids.
- Drifting CMB cold spots (~1°/Gyr).
- Smooth Hubble gradient matching local vs. early-universe tensions.

Falsifiable with upcoming Euclid (cosmology release ~Oct 2026), DESI BAO environmental probes, Roman, and CMB maps.

### The Model (Teaser)
Toy Lagrangian:  
ℒ = ½ (∂ϕ/∂t)² − ½ (∂ϕ/∂x)² − ½ m²ϕ² − ϕ ∂ϕ/∂x + (κ/2) (∂²ϕ/∂x²)²  

Equation of motion:  
∂²ϕ/∂t² − ∂²ϕ/∂x² + m²ϕ + 2 ∂ϕ/∂x + κ ∂⁴ϕ/∂x⁴ = 0
